                    Team members will act with respect and courtesy towards each other. This means using common sense and good faith in communicating your situation. Team members will inform the team if they can not make a scheduled meeting or deadline as soon as possible after they realize they will miss it. Communication should be over slack or group text. In general the expectation is that everyone acts like an adult, takes responsibility for themselves and their tasks, and communicates issues and challenges in a timely manner.

                    When applicable the preferred style of the language being used will be followed (e.g. PEP for python). Names should be descriptive and easy to understand. In general the code should be either well commented or written in a very clear manner.

                    Git will be used with two main branches. A master branch from which feature branches are forked and then pulled back into and a production branch which will be updated from master when features have been thoroughly checked and vetted for deployment. The pipeline for a new feature is this: fork off master, implement feature, pull request into master, code review (optional), production testing of master branch, pull master into production, continuous deployment from production. Code review is generally encouraged to ensure the quality of pull requests but it is not a strict requirement.
